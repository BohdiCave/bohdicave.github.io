Web developer with a background in social science and a passion for arts and humanities, aiming to create an aesthetically pleasing, socially meaningful, and functionally accessible user experience on the web. Earning a certificate in full stack development (MERN stack) from University of Pennsylvania, acquiring skills in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (including CSS frameworks, JS libraries, and responsive web design) and, on the backend, in MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. Always passionate about quality, I am known to pay attention to detail without losing focus of the overall concept. Focused on mobile-first, accessible design and development.
